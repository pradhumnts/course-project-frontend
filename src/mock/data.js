Mutations to 3 or 4 globin genes are usually incompatible with life or require lifelong blood transfusions.&nbsp; In contrast, patients with defects in 1 or 2 of the alpha-globin chains (alpha-thalassemia minima or minor) or 1 beta-globin chain (<strong>beta-thalassemia minor</strong>) are usually asymptomatic.&nbsp;

The <strong>disproportionately elevated RBC count</strong> (eg, normal or high rather than low) and decreased MCV help distinguish thalassemia minor from iron deficiency anemia, which does not typically cause microcytosis until hemoglobin is &lt;10 g/dL <strong>(Choice F)</strong>.&nbsp;
